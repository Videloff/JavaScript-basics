# JavaScript Basic Exercises

## Introduction
In this project, we will practice JavaScript to familiarize yourself with the basic syntax of the language. This project will mainly involve variable declarations, loops, and other concepts covered in the resource of the day. The goal is to master the fundamentals before learning how to animate your website with JavaScript. We'll start with simple exercises, and you'll only need to create an index.html page that calls the script.js file containing your code for the day.

## The Project
For this project, we will revisit basic programming exercises that you have already done during your first weeks at THP. This will be an opportunity for you to see the progress you've made and how far you've come, as your challenge will no longer be about solving the problem (you've already done that) but about transitioning from one language to another.

### 2.1 Hello World
When learning a new language, the first step is usually the famous "Hello world" program.

#### 2.1.1 Greetings
Create a script named `script_1.js` that will display "Bonjour, monde !" (French for "Hello, world!") in the console.

#### 2.1.2 Greetings with Customization
Customize the `script_1.js` script to prompt the user for their first name. Store this input in a variable and display: "Bonjour, prénom !" (French for "Hello, first name!") in the console.

### 2.2 Operations & Loops
#### 2.2.1 Quick Calculations
Create a script named `script_2.js` that defines a factorial function and calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user. Here's a quick example: `factorial(5) = 5*4*3*2*1` and `factorial(10) = 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1`.

The script should do the following:

1. Display a prompt with the question: "De quel nombre veux-tu calculer la factorielle ?" (French for "Which number would you like to calculate the factorial of?")
2. The user enters a number (e.g., 4).
3. The following result is displayed in the console: "Le résultat est : 24" (French for "The result is: 24").

#### 2.2.2 Mario's Pyramid
Ah, Mario's pyramid from the pre-course. Such good memories! You will write a script called `script_3.js`.
The user enters a number (e.g., 5). The console should display the pyramid.

### 2.3 Data Analysis
2.3.1 Startup Nation
You are writing a book about American entrepreneurs and researching their birth dates to identify successful years.

During your research, you come across an array containing famous entrepreneurs and their birth dates.
Create a script script_4.js that will display the following questions and their answers in the console:

Filter the list to only include entrepreneurs born in the 1970s.
Create an array that contains the first name and last name of each entrepreneur.
Calculate the age of each entrepreneur today.
Sort the entrepreneurs in alphabetical order by last name.

### 2.3.2. Librarian
It's your first day of internship at the local middle school's library. You need to assist the librarian in generating statistics from the school's book database, and she provides you with the following dataset to familiarize yourself with the program's back-office.

### 2.4.1. Code of Life
In this exercise, you will write a JavaScript script (script_6.js) to translate a given RNA sequence into a sequence of amino acids using the genetic code.

You need to implement a function that takes an RNA sequence as input and prints the corresponding sequence of amino acids to the console.

Example:
Input RNA sequence: "UUACGCAGUAGA"
Output: "Leucine-Arginine-Serine-Arginine"

You will also have two additional RNA sequences to translate into proteins.

#### 2.4.2. Acne-Bot
In this exercise, you will implement a chat-bot called "Acne-Bot" using JavaScript (script_7.js).

The bot will engage in a conversation with the user using the following rules:

If the user asks a question, the bot responds with "Ouais Ouais..."
If the user shouts (uses only uppercase letters), the bot responds with "Pwa, calme-toi..."
If the user mentions the word "Fortnite," the bot responds with "on s' fait une partie soum-soum ?"
If the user sends an empty message, the bot responds with "t'es en PLS ?"
For any other input, the bot responds with "balek."
To interact with the bot, a prompt window will open for the user to enter a sentence, and the bot's response will be printed to the console.

Note: The bot's responses are in French.
